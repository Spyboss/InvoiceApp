## 🛠️ Requirements (for development)

```
Python 3.10+
pip install reportlab
```

Tkinter is included with standard Python installations on Windows.

---

## ▶️ Running the App (Dev Mode)

```bash
python invoice_app.py
```

---

## 🏗️ Build Windows EXE (No Python Required to Run)

Use PyInstaller:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --add-data "download.png;." invoice_app.py
```

The `.exe` will appear inside:

```
dist/invoice_app.exe
```

### ✔️ After building, the EXE will run on any Windows machine — even without Python.

---

## 📤 Output Files

### **PDF invoices**

Generated into:

```
output/{INVOICE_TYPE}-{YEAR}/
```

Example:

```
output/SALES-2025/0001_John_Doe.pdf
```

### **CSV data**

* `invoice_log.csv` — invoice number counters
* `invoices.csv` — all invoices ever created
* Exported CSVs:

```
output/exports/invoices_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
```

## 💡 How It Works

1. You select invoice type.
2. Fill customer + vehicle details.
3. App generates next invoice number based on year + type.
4. PDF is created via ReportLab.
5. Data goes into the CSV files for record-keeping.

## 📦 Default Dealer Details

The app auto-fills:

* Dealer name
* Dealer contact
* Finance company
* Finance company address
* Default vehicle model dropdown

All can be edited inside the UI.

---

## 🐞 Known Limitations

* UI is basic (Tkinter).
* PDF layout is fixed — not responsive.
* No validation for incorrect numeric inputs yet.
